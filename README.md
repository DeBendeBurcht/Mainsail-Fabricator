# Mainsail-Fabricator
This theme has been modified by me to elevate the interface of my Fabricator 3d Printer ive built.
A Mainsail dark theme with Rich dark green accents and transparent glass like effects.
Based on [acryl-fluidd-mainsail-theme by eliteSchwein](https://github.com/eliteSchwein/acryl-fluidd-mainsail-theme/tree/main) and animated background from [mainsail-theme-elegance by Turbine1991](https://github.com/Turbine1991/mainsail-theme-elegance).
